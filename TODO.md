# TODO
>> A scratchpad for ideas

1. Aliaz syncs single target 'aliaz' file with a gist
 * Can name the gist or use default
 * Each gist name needs unique file name
  * Store each aliaz file as object

2. Sync Management*
 * Show list of available gists on Github
 * Allow user to subscribe/unsubscribe to those gists
 * Maintain an ~/.aliaz folder with a manifest file
 * Refresh bash after sync
 * !!

* This is the start of a strategy that will make this truly useful and modular
